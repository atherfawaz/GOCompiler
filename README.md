# GO--Compiler

A tiny compiler for Go-- language written in C++20 for our course on Compiler Construction.

## Setup

We used the compiler [mingw](https://nav.dl.sourceforge.net/project/mingw-w64/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe) to run our code in [Clion 2021](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atherfawaz/GOCompiler.git
```

## Running the program

```bash
Open folder in Clion
Ensure that the right compiler is selected
Run the program

```
Our lexer will be accepting any input file containing GO-- source code.
